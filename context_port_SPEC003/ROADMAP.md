# Roadmap â€” Beyond SPEC-003

- **SPEC-004: Loomweaver Mentor**
  - Author guidance overlays.
  - Inline feedback + explainability.
  - Richer teaching/authoring aids.

- **Future packs**
  - Finance, robotics, media ops.
  - Capability-gated, fixture-backed.

- **Monetization**
  - Long-term: Loom language + Loomweaver toolchain + derivative agents.

Core invariant: Determinism, reproducibility, and auditability never sacrificed.
