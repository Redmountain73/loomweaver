# Vision & Philosophy

Loom is designed to let humans express programs in plain natural language,
while Loomweaver guarantees determinism, safety, and auditability.

- **Authors write:** `Summarize`, `Report`, `Draft`, `Compare`â€¦
- **Compiler expands:** To canonical verbs (`Make`, `Show`, `Call`, `Ask`, `Choose`, `Repeat`, `Return`).
- **Receipts:** Every run leaves a transparent, deterministic receipt.
- **Overlays:** Extend vocabulary safely; always compile-time only, never at runtime.

Goal: AI-native programming language that is flexible for humans, strict for machines.
