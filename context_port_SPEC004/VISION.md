# Loom Vision

Generated: 2025-09-20 00:22:53Z

Loom is a natural-language-first programming language for building intelligent, reflexive, interconnected agents.
Authors write with friendly verbs, Loomweaver compiles them into a frozen canonical IR, and every run yields deterministic, auditable receipts.

SPEC-004 expands this vision with Loomweaver Mentor: a GPT-powered agent that guides authors interactively.
