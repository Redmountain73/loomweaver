# SPEC-004 Context Port — Loomweaver Mentor

This bundle marks the transition from SPEC-003 (Overlays) to SPEC-004 (Loomweaver Mentor).

## What SPEC-003 Achieved
- Overlay packs (core + research)
- CLI overlay flags
- Receipts with lineage fields
- Deterministic golden tests
- CI green across Python 3.11 & 3.13

## What SPEC-004 Will Achieve
- Introduce Loomweaver Mentor (a GPT agent for authors).
- Provide inline author feedback when writing Loom.
- Add teaching overlays for interactive guidance.
- Strengthen Loom’s identity as not just a compiler, but a collaborator.

## Why This Matters
- Loom is not “chatbot soup.” Overlays deterministically expand into frozen canonical verbs.
- Receipts remain central — Loom’s differentiator from JSON hacks or chatbot wrappers.
- SPEC-004 is the first step in making Loom not just usable, but teachable and scalable.
