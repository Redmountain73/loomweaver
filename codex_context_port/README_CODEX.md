# Codex Context Port for Loom/Loomweaver

Generated: 2025-09-17 22:19:20Z

## Vision
Pair OpenAI **Codex** with this repo inside VS Code so natural language tasks become auditable branches and PRs. Codex reads/edit files you open, runs commands you approve, and can move work between local and cloud.

## What’s inside
- `TEAM_LOOM_CODEX.md` — roles and working norms
- `SPEC-CODEX-000.md` — install, sign-in, GitHub linking, usage patterns
- `tasks/001_overlay_flags.md` — SPEC-003 tasks for overlay flags
- `tasks/002_receipts_lineage.md` — SPEC-003 receipts enrichment tasks
- `scripts/setup_github_remote.sh` — safe remote add/push

## Quickstart
1. Install the Codex IDE extension in VS Code and sign in with ChatGPT (see SPEC-CODEX-000).
2. Connect your GitHub account when prompted.
3. Open this repo, create a feature branch, and run the tasks in `tasks/`.
