# Team Loom — Codex Roles

- **You (Architect/Founder)** — sets direction, approves merges.
- **Nova (Mentor)** — keeps philosophy and invariants aligned.
- **SA (Software Architect GPT)** — executes specs, writes patches, fixes CI.
- **Codex** — hands-on coding partner inside VS Code: reads open files, proposes edits, runs commands with your consent, and prepares diffs.

## Working norms
- One small task at a time; branch + PR per task.
- Keep SPEC-002 green; SPEC-003 lands behind flags.
- Always review Codex diffs; receipts remain source of truth.
